# secure electronic voting machine using Azur blockchain
>The motive of this project would keep the thing as it is for voters and making the voting system secure by means the user or voter will have to visit the nearby boot and do whatever things he/she was doing earlier there should be no requirement for voters to learn new things. Making it more secure using the Microsoft Azur.
# vote as currency
>As the heading says we will be using the vote  of voters as currency and each party will  refer to as account of bank and  a bank to provide the currency to customer that is voters (actually only reference number of currency in there account real transfer will take place from general account)to put into one of the all accounts(party) they want to.
# internet accessible areas
we will need 
* .a general account or wallet 
* .an account for each party
* .data of voters
>so as the voters give their details at the voting boot the smart contract will connect to the fingerprint data stored in id  then if the voters fingerprint match then there is increment in the number with secondly mapped with the reference id of currency the currency id provided by the general account then  the voter will have to select account one wants to cast a vote . Now the mapped number will be decrement and the general account will transfer the currency to that account. and write a transaction with all this reference number on blockchain and numbers (which will randomly be generated by the network for each currency id)
# place with no internet access
>for places with no access to the internet, it needs to store in some unalterable memory in the form of blockchain, as it is said that there is a problem in EVM machine that hackers alter the address of vote through some technical medium, I thought of some idea hope that will work...
# voting machine 
>we can have machine (like EVM but on screen) has fingerprint of voter matches, voter will have to click 2 times at any time in 30 sec interval(or whichever will be convenient)  then machine will  close and instantaneously apply machine learning algorithm to predict the vote and also the button response if they match store in blockchain network and then erase the video.
